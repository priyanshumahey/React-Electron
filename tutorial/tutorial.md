# Tutorial
## Introduction
This tutorial aims to go over both Electron and React.js in an attempt to help you set up a desktop application built on electron.js with the frontend being done using React.

This tutorial assumes you already have node and npm installed and running. To ensure both of them are running, run the following commands
``` PS
node -v
npm -v
```
These commands run versions and will check if they are present on the computer. The version of Node.js doesn't amtter since Electron embeds Node.js into its binary meaning that the version running on your computer doesn't matter.

## Electron
**What is Electron?**

Electron.js is a backend builder which enables you to build applications. Many common desktop apps such as Visual Studio Code, Slack, Messenger are build based off of Electron.

Electron relies on Chromium and Node.js and creates cross-platform applications with no native development required.
